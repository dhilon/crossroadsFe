          This game delves into both the complex natures of game theory and the trustworthiness of cooperation. Choose the side that you think other people will not choose. Whichever side has the least amount of 
          votes by the hour will get a certain amount of points added to the score and their streak increased by one. 
          Use other tools on screen to help you decide the road you will take.
